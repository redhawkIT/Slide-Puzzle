# Slider-Puzzle
The Slide-Puzzle is the generalised version of the [8-puzzle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle))
**The problem:** The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle popularized by Sam Loyd in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order. The player is permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically into the blank square.
